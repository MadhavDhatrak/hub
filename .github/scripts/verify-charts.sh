# Verify that every Helm chart artifact referenced by a formula.yaml actually
# exists in its OCI registry at the declared version.
#
# The hub renders install instructions from spec.artifacts.chart.channels.*.ref
# and .version, so a typo or an unpublished/yanked version would hand users a
# `helm install` command that fails. This check confirms each referenced chart
# is pullable before we advertise it.
#
# Extensions without a chart artifact (gated / URL-less entries such as mssql)
# are skipped: there is nothing to verify.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .github/scripts/verify-charts.sh
#
# Requires: yq (mikefarah, v4+), helm 3.8+ (OCI support). Exits non-zero if any
# referenced chart cannot be resolved.
